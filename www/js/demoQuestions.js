A sensory level is characteristic. Midline or dermatomal neuropathic pain can be present. Urinary incontinence or retention, bowel incontinence or constipation, and sexual dysfunction are common but vary in severity. These signs develop over hours to days, and are usually bilateral.</p>  <p>There are a variety of causes, but it most often occurs as an autoimmune phenomenon after an infection or vaccination, or as a result of direct infection, an underlying systemic autoimmune disease, or an acquired demyelinating disease. For a significant proportion of cases no cause is found.</p>  <p>MRI is indicated to rule out the presence of structural lesions, and determine the presence of myelitis which enhances with gadolinium in the acute phase. There may be more than one area of myelitis, and the lesions usually span at least two vertebral segments. In the acute phase the MRI may be normal.</p>  <p>Treatment in the acute phase aims to halt the progression and initiate resolution of the inflammatory cord lesion. Corticosteroids are first line, and are initially given in high doses intravenously. Plasma exchange can be given to those who fail to respond. Patients with demyelinating disease can be started on long term immunosuppression.</p>  <p>The prognosis is highly variable, and improvement can take three months and longer to develop. A rapidly progressive course, severe weakness, hypotonia and areflexia are predictors of poor prognosis. Fifty per cent to 70% of patients have partial or complete recovery.</p>  <p>Whilst multiple sclerosis may be a possible underlying cause in this young lady, the proximity to an infection and the lack of history of other neurological deficits makes it less likely.</p>  <p>Guillain-Barre syndrome presents with ascending progressive symmetrical weakness, with lower motor neurone signs.<br />  Anterior spinal artery occlusion typically presents with a flaccid paraplegia or quadriplegia (depending on the level). It is usually associated with atherosclerosis or aortic dissection, and would therefore be unusual in this age group.</p>  <p>A thoracic disc prolapse would be seen on MRI.</p>  <p><strong>References &amp; Further Reading:</strong><br />  Transverse Myelitis.

                                          comment: "<p>This patient has had three transient ischaemic attacks in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Compared to a person in sinus rhythm, a patient with atrial fibrillation has a fivefold increased risk of stroke (largely due to the increased risk of atrial thrombosis which can embolise to the brain). Stroke mortality is also higher than those without atrial fibrillation. Assessment is therefore given with regard to the need for anticoagulation.</p>  <p>Lower risk patients, as calculated by the CHADS2-VASC score &lt;2, do not need antithrombotic prophylaxis. They have a low annual risk of stroke, which is not significantly reduced by either warfarin or aspirin. Aspirin may be considered if there are other indications (for example, ischaemic heart disease or peripheral arterial disease).</p>  <p><strong>CHADS2-VASC Score</strong>:</p>  <ul> <li>Heart failure or ejection fraction &lt;35%: 1</li>  <li>Hypertension: 1</li>  <li>Age: 65-74 years 1, more than 75 years 2</li>  <li>Diabetes: 1</li>  <li>Stroke, TIA or systemic emboli: 2</li>  <li>Vascular disease (previous MI, peripheral arterial disease, aortic plaque): 1.</li> </ul>  <p>Higher risk patients (CHADS2-VASC 2+, annual stroke rate over 3%) should be considered for warfarin at a target INR of 2.5. Warfarin has been shown to have a relative risk reduction for stroke of 68% and death 33%. The minimum risk of stroke has been shown to occur in the INR range 2.0-3.0. There is an excess of two intracranial bleeds per year per thousand patients treated, usually associated with an INR greater than 3 and uncontrolled hypertension.</p>  <p>There are however contraindications to warfarin, which include increased risk of bleeding, poor compliance and recurrent falls. Aspirin can be used as an alternative in these patients. Although less effective (20% relative risk reduction of stroke) it is simpler and less hazardous.</p>  <p>Cardioversion is indicated in select patients with AF, but there is a risk of systemic thromboembolism for those who have been in AF for more than two weeks. Patients with very recent onset AF require immediate assessment and treatment with heparin. If it is certain the AF has been present for two days or less, cardioversion can be attempted (electrical or pharmacological). Warfarin is not required if cardioversion is successful. If present for more than two days, warfarin is given for three weeks before cardioversion is attempted, and continued for at least four weeks following. Continuing warfarin should be considered for patients at high risk of recurrence (large left atrium, poor left ventricular function, hypertension) or previously symptomatic AF.</p>  <p>The most appropriate therapeutic strategy for this patient would be warfarin due to his high CHADS2-VASC score. It is important to note, however, that anticoagulant therapy after an acute cerebral ischaemic event should be delayed until most of the deficit has resolved, or more than two weeks has elapsed for more severe strokes.</p>  <p>Digoxin may be indicated as a rate control agent, but will not reduce the risk of subsequent stroke. In the context of cerebrovascular disease, dipyridamole is only indicated if clopidogrel and/or aspirin are not tolerated.</p>  <p><strong>References &amp; Further Reading:</strong><br />  SIGN Guideline 36.

                                          comment: "<p>Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystem vascular dysplasia characterised by the presence of multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that lack intervening capillaries and result in direct connections between arteries and veins. Small AVMs, called telangiectases, close to the surface of skin and mucous membranes often rupture and bleed. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.</p>  <p>The most common clinical manifestations of HHT are spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis and multiple telangiectases which commonly appear on the lips, face, tongue or hands in adulthood. A minority of individuals with HHT have symptomatic gastrointestinal bleeding, which most commonly begins after age 50 years.</p>  <p>Large AVMs often cause symptoms when they occur in the brain or lung; complications from bleeding or shunting may be sudden and catastrophic. It is estimated at least 30% of HHT patients have pulmonary involvement, 30% hepatic involvement and 10-20% cerebral involvement.</p>  <p>The manifestations of HHT generally develop with age, and are usually not present at birth. Epistaxis is usually the earliest sign of disease, often occurring in childhood. Pulmonary AVMs can become apparent from puberty. By the age of 16 years 71% of patients will have developed signs of HHT, rising to over 90% by 40 years.</p>  <p>The Curacao criteria can be used to aid diagnosis:</p>  <p>The diagnosis is:</p>  <ul> <li>Definite if three criteria are present</li>  <li>&#39;Possible&#39; or &#39;suspected&#39; if two criteria are present</li>  <li>&#39;Unlikely&#39; if fewer than two criteria are present.</li> </ul>  <p>Criteria are:</p>  <ul> <li>Epistaxis: spontaneous, recurrent nose bleeds</li>  <li>Telangiectases: multiple, characteristic sites (lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose)</li>  <li>Visceral lesions, such as gastrointestinal telangiectasia, pulmonary AVM, hepatic AVM, cerebral AVM, spinal AVM</li>  <li>Family history of a first degree relative with HHT.</li> </ul>  <p>Cerebral involvement can be in the form of telangiectasias, cerebral AVMs, aneurysms or cavernous angiomas. Cerebral AVMs are thought to affect 10% of patients, and can result in headaches, seizures, surrounding ischaemia (steal) or haemorrhage. These lead to significant mortality and morbidity.</p>  <p>Management of epistaxis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage should be symptomatic initially. Whilst it is generally regarded that pulmonary AVMs should be screened for (and treated with prophylactic antibiotics and embolisation), screening for cerebral and hepatic AVMs remains controversial and is not currently offered in the UK. Oestrogen therapy is sometimes advocated but its efficacy is unclear. It may be beneficial in heavily transfusion dependent patients.</p>  <p><strong>Reference &amp; Further Reading:</strong><br />  Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome): a view from the 21st century.

                                          comment: "<p>The history of dyspnoea and desaturation on exercise in an HIV-positive patient would suggest PCP.</p>  <p><em>Pneumocystis jiroveci</em> is a eukaryotic microorganism. In immunosuppressed patients it can cause a pneumonia which is most recognised in patients with AIDS but can also be seen in those with organ transplants or when undergoing chemotherapy. A CD4 count of less than 200 is associated with significant risk.</p>  <p>In Europe, the USA and Australia <em>P. jiroveci</em> pneumonia in HIV-positive patients is seen largely in those unaware of their HIV status. Unfortunately it is a major cause of death in Africa, especially in children. Previously it was thought that disease was caused by reactivation of latent infection acquired in childhood, but de novo infection is increasingly recognised.</p>  <p>The pneumonia caused by <em>P. jiroveci</em> is potentially severe and fatal in immunosuppressed patients. Clinically it presents with several weeks&#39; history of dry cough, fever and dyspnoea. Examination findings are often subtle, but include tachypnoea, tachycardia, cyanosis and fine respiratory crackles. Typically, patients desaturate markedly on exertion.</p>  <p>There may be reduced transfer factor, vital capacity and total lung capacity on spirometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum can be used to demonstrate the organism (open lung biopsy is gold standard, but rarely performed in clinical practice). Giemsa, Papanicolaou and Grocott&#39;s stains are used.</p>  <p>There are a variety of different chest radiograph findings. Typically it causes bilateral symmetrical perihilar reticular or granular interstitial shadowing. Less often there can be asymmetric shadowing, or progression to a reticular-alveolar pattern. Occasionally lobar consolidation, nodular lesions, prominent pulmonary arteries, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, cysts or pneumatoceles can be seen.</p>  <p>In patients who have been on prophylactic inhaled pentamidine the infiltrates may predominantly affect the upper lobes. A normal chest x ray does not exclude the diagnosis. Pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy are not typical, but be aware of the possibility of multiple disease processes in an immunosuppressed patient.</p>  <p>If allowed to progress, <em>P.jiroveci</em> can disseminate via the lymphatic and haematogenous routes to affect the thyroid, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. </p>  <p>If PCP is suspected, treatment with full dose co-trimoxazole should be started as soon as possible. It should be given for 21 days in HIV-positive cases, but shorter doses can be used in other causes of immunosuppression. In patients who are intolerant of co-trimoxazole, intravenous pentamidine can be used. Some studies have shown that corticosteroids can reduce the risk of respiratory failure, and they are therefore used in some cases.</p>  <p>Prophylaxis should be used in immunosuppressed patients who are at risk of developing PCP: all those with a CD<sub>4</sub> count of &lt;200, patients started on high dose steroids, and those on chemotherapeutic regimens associated with significant immunosuppression. Co-trimoxazole is also a first line prophylactic agent.</p>  <p>Pulmonary hypertension does develop with increased frequency in patients with HIV, but this is secondary rather than primary. Primary pulmonary hypertension is rare, and more commonly affects females.</p>  <p>Anaemia is a possibility, but the chest x ray findings and history of HIV make PCP more likely.</p>  <p>Atrial septal defects with intracardiac shunting can eventually lead to hypoxia (Eisenmenger syndrome), but this is less likely than PCP in patients known to be HIV-positive.</p>  <p>This history may also be consistent with multiple small pulmonary emboli, but again this is less likely than PCP in an HIV-positive patient.</p>  <p><strong>References &amp; Further Reading:</strong></p>  <p><em><em><i>Pneumocystis carinii</i></em></em> Infection Update and Review.

All of these are present in the history and should lead you to the diagnosis of Churg- Strauss.</p>  <p>The most commonly involved organ is the lung, followed by the skin. CSS, however, can affect any organ system, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The unifying feature of patients presenting with CSS is asthma. Vasculitis involving the peripheral nervous system is also a characteristic feature, and mononeuritis multiplex occurs in 75% of patients.</p>  <p>Vasculitis of extrapulmonary organs is largely responsible for the morbidity and mortality associated with CSS. Forty per cent  to 60% are associated with positive ANCA, usually pANCA/MPO.</p>  <p>ANCA are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Several different staining patterns and antigen specificities are recognised. The cytoplasmic staining pattern, cANCA, and specificity for the PR3 antigen is most specific for Wegener&#39;s granulomatosis. Perinuclear staining, pANCA, and/or antibody to MPO are far less specific than cANCA and can be present in a range of inflammatory conditions such as microscopic polyangitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome and Goodpasture&#39;s syndrome.</p>  <p>MPO and pANCA may also be present in SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome and occasionally in chronic infections.<br />  Intravenous glucocorticoid is used for initial therapy of acute multi-organ involvement in Churg-Strauss syndrome, followed by oral glucocorticoid therapy, often with azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent. Loss of vision is rare but can occur and must be treated aggressively.</p>  <p>Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a hypersensitivity reaction to <em>Aspergillus</em>. Its clinical presentation varies from corticosteroid-dependent asthma to diffuse bronchiectasis with fibrosis. Visual loss is not an associated feature.</p>  <p>Wegener&#39;s granulomatosis is a multi-organ autoimmune disease, which can be fatal. The classical triad consists of necrotising granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract, glomerulonephritis and a small vessel vasculitis. A prolonged history of epistaxis or sinusitis is commonly found in Wegener&#39;s granulomatosis, which in some patients is also associated with an eosinophilia.</p>  <p>Hypereosinophilic syndrome is characterised by a peripheral blood eosinophil count of &gt;1.5 for more than six months. Generalised symptoms are fatigue, myalgia, fever, night sweats, diarrhoea and pruritis.

There may also be atrophy of the subcutaneous tissues, but intermittent claudication and rest pain may be absent due to co-existent neuropathy.</p>  <p>Diabetic foot infections are common and always serious, and range in severity from superficial paronychia to deep infection and gangrene.</p>  <p>Other manifestations include:</p>  <ul> <li>Cellulitis</li>  <li>Myositis</li>  <li>Abscesses</li>  <li>Necrotising fasciitis</li>  <li>Septic arthritis</li>  <li>Tendonitis </li>  <li>Osteomyelitis.</li> </ul>  <p>All are associated with increased frequency and length of hospitalisation, and risk of lower extremity amputation.</p>  <p>Neuropathy, vascular insufficiency and reduced neutrophil function all mean that diabetics are more susceptible to foot ulceration.</p>  <p>Once skin ulceration occurs, the underlying tissues are exposed to colonisation by pathogenic organisms. The inflammatory response is often impaired, and therefore early signs of infection may be subtle. Local signs of wound infection are:</p>  <ul> <li>Granulation tissue that becomes increasingly friable</li>  <li>Yellow or grey moist tissue at the base of the ulcer</li>  <li>Purulent discharge and</li>  <li>An unpleasant odour.</li> </ul>  <p>The most common pathogens in acute, previously untreated superficial ulcers in diabetic patients are aerobic Gram positive bacteria (particularly <em><em><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></em></em> and beta-haemolytic <em>Streptococci</em>).</p>  <p>In patients who have recently received antibiotics or who have deep tissue involvement, infection is usually caused by a mixture of aerobic Gram positive, Gram negative (for example, <em><em><em><em><i>Escherichia coli</i></em></em></em></em>, <em>Proteus</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>) and anaerobic organisms (for example, <em>Bacteroides</em>, <em>Clostridium</em>).</p>  <p>Methicillin-resistant <em><em><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></em></em> (MRSA) is more common in patients who have been previously hospitalised or who have received antibiotic therapy, although increasingly it is community acquired.</p>  <p>If infection is suspected, deep swab and tissue samples should be sent for culture and broad-spectrum antibiotics started. The presence of deep infection with abscess, cellulitis gangrene or osteomyelitis is an indication for hospitalisation.</p>  <p>Indications for urgent surgical intervention are:</p>  <ul> <li>A large area of infected sloughy tissue</li>  <li>Localised fluctuance and expression of pus</li>  <li>Crepitus in the soft tissues on radiological examination</li>  <li>Purplish discolouration of the skin (which indicates subcutaneous necrosis).</li> </ul>  <p>Antibiotic treatment should subsequently be tailored according to the clinical response, culture results and sensitivity.

It is caused by circulating antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, and typically causes an acute glomerulonephritis. It usually presents in young men in their twenties and men and women in their sixties. Despite treatment the mortality of Goodpasture&#39;s is 11% and it has a high morbidity with 60% of patients becoming dependent on dialysis. Renal impairment is caused by a crescentic glomerulonephritis. </p>  <p>It frequently has an eruptive presentation in the young, with:</p>  <ul> <li>Cough</li>  <li>Fever</li>  <li>Haemoptysis</li>  <li>Haematuria</li>  <li>Proteinuria</li>  <li>Red cell casts.</li> </ul>  <p>The pulmonary haemorrhage and glomerular bleeding can result in a drop in haemoglobin.</p>  <p>The most common antibody associated with Goodpasture&#39;s is antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies (anti-GBM). Anti-GBM antibodies are directed against the Goodpasture antigen, which is part of the non-collagenous domain of the alpha-3(4) collagen chain. However, recently it has been shown that in a significant number of patients with Goodpasture&#39;s syndrome antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) can coexist with anti-GBM antibodies - in one study 30% of patients had positive ANCA serology. In this setting ANCA is usually specific for p-ANCA and is directed against myeloperoxidase.</p>  <p>In general, both antibodies can be detected at presentation. This seropositivity has been shown to have important clinical and prognostic implications, and these patients may develop extra-renal and extra-pulmonary manifestations. In addition they are more likely to have recurrent renal or pulmonary disease. Prognosis is debated with some studies saying it is more favourable in patients with positive ANCA and others showing a worse outcome in these patients.</p>  <p>Plasmapheresis and immunosuppression (typically with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid) is the treatment of choice in Goodpasture&#39;s syndrome. This has been shown to reduce anti-GBM antibodies most rapidly, which results in improved morbidity and mortality. Plasmapheresis is typically given daily or on alternate days for two to three weeks. Response is assessed by monitoring symptoms and anti-GBM antibody titres. Cyclophosphamide and prednisolone then continue, typically for six to nine months following remission. </p>  <p>Alport&#39;s syndrome is a familial nephritis which  presents with haematuria, progressive renal failure, ocular abnormalities and sensorineural deafness. It is caused by mutation within the type IV collagen genes. Inheritance is variable, but the majority are X linked dominant (85%; 15% are autosomal recessive). There is a high spontaneous mutation rate, which means 20% of patients have no family history. </p>  <p>Polymyositis classically presents with relatively painless progressive proximal muscle weakness. Dysphagia is common but the ocular muscles are very rare. Diagnosis of polymyositis is confirmed by elevated muscle enzymes (creatine kinase) and typical EMG and muscle biopsy findings.</p>  <p>Relapsing polychondritis is characterised by recurrent episodes of inflammation of cartilaginous structures (joints, respiratory tract, ear, nose) and connective tissue (heart, eye, blood vessels, inner ear). Antibodies to type II collagen may be present.</p>  <p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogenous, inflammatory, multisystem autoimmune inflammatory disease, in which antinuclear antibodies occur.  Its presentation and course are highly variable, ranging from indolent to fulminant. The triad of fever, arthralgia and rash in a woman of childbearing age should suggest the diagnosis.</p>  <p><strong>References:</strong></p>  <p>Goodpasture&#39;s syndrome with positive c-ANCA and normal renal function: A case report.

                                          comment: "<p>The major toxic effects of quinine are on the nervous system, in particular the optic and auditory nerve. It is also particularly toxic on retinal photoreceptor cells, and causes vasoconstriction and spasm of the retinal artery. Blurred vision can proceed to complete blindness, which is characteristic of overdose. Initial signs are narrowing of the retinal arterioles on fundoscopy. Later there is retinal oedema, and the pupils become dilated and unresponsive to light.</p>  <p>Effects on the auditory nerve may cause tinnitus and deafness, but not hyperacusis.</p>  <p>Initially quinine causes generalised stimulation of the central nervous system, leading to tachycardia, fever, delirium and tachypnoea. In severe overdose it can then cause myocardial depression, peripheral vasodiltation and widened QRS with prolonged QTc and risk of VT, torsade and VF.</p>  <p>In addition, renal failure, haemolytic anaemia and gastrointestinal disturbance can develop. At very high plasma levels, sinoatrial block and high-degree atrioventricular block may be seen. Hypotension may occur secondary to quinine&#39;s alpha-blocking effect, but is not as characteristic as blindness.</p>  <p>Additional features include nausea, vomiting, headache, seizures,  fatigue, tremor and ataxia. Hyperglycaemia is not characteristic.</p>  <p>Management is with activated charcoal and gastric lavage, if presentation is early enough. Bradycardia can be treated with atropine or pacing. Bicarbonate is considered for a prolonged QRS (&gt;120ms), aiming for a pH of 7.45-5. Haemodialysis can also be used to clear the quinine. There is no specific treatment for visual disturbance. </p>",
